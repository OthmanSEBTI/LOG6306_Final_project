Hear me roar.//* [ ] Correct spell-checking the right way before merge.////## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments//We have had two classes of tests that don't work in our usual build-machine testing environment://1. Tests that require interactive UI automation or input injection (a.k.a. require a logged in user)//2. Tests that require the entire Windows Terminal to stand up (because our Xaml Islands dependency requires 1903 or later and the Windows Server instance for the build is based on 1809.)////The Helix testing environment solves both of these and is brought to us by our friends over in https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml.////This PR takes a large portion of scripts and pipeline configuration steps from the Microsoft-UI-XAML repository and adjusts them for Terminal needs.//You can see the source of most of the files in either https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/tree/master/build/Helix or https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/tree/master/build/AzurePipelinesTemplates////Some of the modifications in the files include (but are not limited to) reasons like://- Our test binaries are named differently than MUX's test binaries//- We don't need certain types of testing that MUX does.//- We use C++ and C# tests while MUX was using only C# tests (so the naming pattern and some of the parsing of those names is different e.g. :: separators in C++ and . separators in C#)//- Our pipeline phases work a bit differently than MUX and/or we need significantly fewer pieces to the testing matrix (like we don't test a wide variety of OS versions).////The build now runs in a few stages://1. The usual build and run of unit tests/feature tests, packaging verification, and whatnot. This phase now also picks up and packs anything required for running tests in Helix into an artifact. (It also unifies the artifact name between the things Helix needs and the existing build outputs into the single `drop` artifact to make life a little easier.)//2. The Helix preparation build runs that picks up those artifacts, generates all the scripts required for Helix to understand the test modules/functions from our existing TAEF tests, packs it all up, and queues it on the Helix pool.//3. Helix generates a VM for our testing environment and runs all the TAEF tests that require it. The orchestrator at helix.dot.net watches over this and tracks the success/fail and progress of each module and function. The scripts from our MUX friends handle installing dependencies, making the system quiet for better reliability, detecting flaky tests and rerunning them, and coordinating all the log uploads (including for the subruns of tests that are re-run.)//4. A final build phase is run to look through the results with the Helix API and clean up the marking of tests that are flaky, link all the screenshots and console output logs into the AzDO tests panel, and other such niceities.////We are set to run Helix tests on the Feature test policy of only x64 for now. ////Additionally, because the set up of the Helix VMs takes so long, we are *NOT* running these in PR trigger right now as I believe we all very much value our 15ish minute PR turnaround (and the VM takes another 15 minutes to just get going for whatever reason.) For now, they will only run as a rolling build on master after PRs are merged. We should still know when there's an issue within about an hour of something merging and multiple PRs merging fast will be done on the rolling build as a batch run (not one per).////In addition to setting up the entire Helix testing pipeline for the tests that require it, I've preserved our classic way of running unit and feature tests (that don't require an elaborate environment) directly on the build machines. But with one bonus feature... They now use some of the scripts from MUX to transform their log data and report it to AzDO so it shows up beautifully in the build report. (We used to have this before I removed the MStest/VStest wrapper for performance reasons, but now we can have reporting AND performance!) See https://dev.azure.com/ms/terminal/_build/results?buildId=101654&view=ms.vss-test-web.build-test-results-tab for an example. ////I explored running all of the tests on Helix but.... the Helix setup time is long and the resources are more expensive. I felt it was better to preserve the ""quick signal"" by continuing to run these directly on the build machine (and skipping the more expensive/slow Helix setup if they fail.) It also works well with the split between PR builds not running Helix and the rolling build running Helix. PR builds will get a good chunk of tests for a quick turn around and the rolling build will finish the more thorough job a bit more slowly.////## Validation Steps Performed//- [x] Ran the updated pipelines with Pull Request configuration ensuring that Helix tests don't run in the usual CI//- [x] Ran with simulation of the rolling build to ensure that the tests now running in Helix will pass. All failures marked for follow on in reference issues.",https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/commit/5d082ffe67c9714472dcc1548c6b5b7b60780d2c,100060912,microsoft/terminal,False,False

It also adds a new microbenchmark to profile thread-pool performance over short loops.////Motivation and Context//MobileNet on a 2*12-core system showed a performance gap between the ORT thread pool and OpenMP. One cause appeared to be false sharing on fields in the thread pool: ThreadPoolParallelSection::tasks_finished (which the main thread spins on waiting for workers to complete a loop), and the RunQueue::front_ and back_ fields (used respectively by the worker thread and the main thread).////The additional micro-benchmark BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor tests performance of loops of different sizes at different thread counts. The results below are on a machine with 2*14-core processors (E5-2690 v4) running with 1, 14, 15, and 28 threads. For each test, the microbenchmark has N threads run a loop with N iterations; hence a perfect result is for the time taken to be constant as additional threads are added (although we will also see power management effects helping at very low thread counts). The loop durations (100000, 10000, 1000) correspond roughly to 200us, 20us, and 2us on this machine.////Before change://BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/1/1/100000/real_time 17153 us 17154 us 32//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/14/14/100000/real_time 22553 us 22553 us 30//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/15/15/100000/real_time 21521 us 21521 us 29//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/28/28/100000/real_time 24111 us 24111 us 24//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/1/1/10000/real_time 1719 us 1719 us 407//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/14/14/10000/real_time 3409 us 3409 us 200//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/15/15/10000/real_time 3541 us 3541 us 201//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/28/28/10000/real_time 4576 us 4576 us 151//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/1/1/1000/real_time 174 us 174 us 4017//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/14/14/1000/real_time 1586 us 1586 us 402//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/15/15/1000/real_time 1586 us 1586 us 397//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/28/28/1000/real_time 2864 us 2864 us 232////After change://BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/1/1/100000/real_time 17160 us 17160 us 33//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/14/14/100000/real_time 20989 us 20989 us 31//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/15/15/100000/real_time 22286 us 22286 us 31//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/28/28/100000/real_time 24631 us 24631 us 25//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/1/1/10000/real_time 1718 us 1718 us 407//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/14/14/10000/real_time 2868 us 2868 us 242//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/15/15/10000/real_time 2907 us 2907 us 240//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/28/28/10000/real_time 3872 us 3872 us 186//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/1/1/1000/real_time 175 us 175 us 3938//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/14/14/1000/real_time 933 us 933 us 659//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/15/15/1000/real_time 912 us 912 us 591//BM_ThreadPoolSimpleParallelFor/28/28/1000/real_time 1976 us 1976 us 317////* fix opset imports for function body  (#6287)////* fix function opsets////* add tests and update onnx////* changes per review comments////* add comments////* plus updates////* build fix////* Remove false positive prefast warning from threadpool (#6324)////* Java: add Semmle to Java publishing pipelines (#6326)////Add Semmle to Java API pipeline//  Add security results publishing and add Java GPU.////* Quantization support for split operator with its NHWC support (#6107)////* Make split working for quantization.////* NHWC transformer support for split operator////* Refactor some according to Feedback.

This lets the thread pool decide on the granularity at which to distribute work (unlike TrySimpleParallelFor). Profiling showed high costs when running ""simple"" loops with 4M iterations each of which copied only 4 bytes.////Second, it updates the sharded loop counter in the thread pool so that the number of shards is capped by the number of threads. This helps make the performance of any other high-contention ""simple"" loops more robust at low thread counts by letting each thread work on its own ""home"" shard for longer.////Motivation and Context////Profiling showed a PGAN model taking 2x+ longer with the non-OpenMP build. The root cause was that the OpenMP build uses simple static scheduling of loop iterations, while the non-OpenMP build uses dynamic scheduling. The combination of large numbers of tiny iterations is less significant with static scheduling --- although still desirable to avoid, given that each iteration incurs a std::function invocation.////* Update document of transformer optimization (#6487)////* nuphar test to avoid test data download to improve passing rate (#6467)////nuphar test to avoid test data download to improve passing rate////* Fuse cuda conv with activation (#6351)////* optimize cuda conv by fused activation////* remove needless print out////* exclude test from cpu////* handle status error from cudnn 8.x////* add reference to base class////* add hipify////* [CoreML EP] Add support for some activations/Transpose, move some shared helpers from NNAPI to shared space (#6498)////* Init change////* Move some helper from nnapi ep to shared////* Add transpose support////* Fix trt ci build break////* Refine transformers profiler output (#6502)////* output nodes in the original order; grouped by node name//* add document for profiler////* Update to match new test setup.

This requires changing all calls from GetReferenced to GetReferencedRelationshipInstances for Peer and Hierarchical relationships. With methods now returning unresolved elements, a new Reference sub class for each Model type is defined. The reference sub types adapts a ModelRelationshipInstance instead of a TSQLObject. Adapting a ModelRelationshipInstance instead of a TSQLObject allows the name of referenced elements to be exposed even if the element is unresolved. It also allows exposing the metadata on relationships (Such as Ascending on the Index.Columns relationship)./For each relationship that has metadata, a new sub type is defined with the metadata properties. This results in the Index.Columns relationship returning an IEnumerable<IndexColumnsReference> where IndexColumnsReference derives from TSQLColumnReference which in-turn derives from TSQLColum./Metadata properties on TSQLObjecs are now exposed. One example of this is TSQLColumn now exposes a ColumnType property which defines if it is a Column, ComputedColumn or ColumnSet./NOTE: In order to facilitate unresolved references, a few edge cases arose. For relationships that returned marker interfaces like ISqlObjectAuthorizer, there was no concrete type known at generation time to instantiate. To work around this issue, a new optional attribute was added to the modelmetadata.xml: UnresolvedReturnType. The UnresolvedReturnType attribute defines the type to instantiate when an unresolved element is found so the return type will still implement the type defined in the ReturnType attribute. This pattern is a little unconventional, however, to enforce the strongly typed returns values of relationships these “Unresolved” types needed to be created to bridge the gap between the strongly typed API and the unresolved nature of the model.",https://github.com/microsoft/DACExtensions/commit/d06af35e34cb355b6e38599638169fc412568dce,30130401,microsoft/DACExtensions,False,False

We currently try to/enforce the 1:1 relationship by checking that a vCPU with the/same id isn't already connected. This is good but unfortunately/not enough because we don't map VP ids to raw vCPU ids but to/packed vCPU ids, and the packing function kvmppc_pack_vcpu_id()/isn't bijective by design. We got away with it because QEMU passes/vCPU ids that fit well in the packing pattern. But nothing prevents/userspace to come up with a forged vCPU id resulting in a packed id/collision which causes the KVM device to associate two vCPUs to the/same VP.

Consumers of this package (`@react-native-windows/cli` and `react-native-windows-init`) are provided this abstraction layer and are therefore no longer expected to understand the intricacies of the underlying telemetry service (Application Insights).////CLI commands are now generally restructured to follow this pattern:////```ts//async function cliCommand(args) {//  // Telemetry setup//  Telemetry.setup();//  Telemetry.startCommand(...);////  let cliCommandError: Error | undefined;//  try {//    await cliCommandInternal(args);//  } catch (error) {//    // Report any error thrown//    Telemetry.trackException(error);//    cliCommandError= error;//  }////  // Telemetry cleanup//  TelemetryTest.endCommand(...);//}//```////With this setup, none of the code within internal function (`cliCommandInternal` here) has any notion of or connection to the telemetry system, other than throwing `CodedError` whenever it hits a known error in our code that we wish to capture. (Note that none of the functionality of any of our commands were changed in this PR, as they were already throwing `CodedError` s with appropriate extra data, where appropriate). Any unknown errors are also caught and recorded by the Telemetry.////In the end, we expect up to two events from every CLI command: `RNWCLI.Command` and potentially one error event: `RNWCLI.CodedError`. The `RNWCLI.Command` event is fired in the call to `endCommand` and contains everything we want to know from a run of our commands, success or failure. If an error was thrown, then we'll also have fired an additional event with the call to `trackException`, including error codes, stack traces, etc. The two events can be correlated to one another via the `sessionId` property.////Every effort has been made to make sure that we can easily extend and update our CLI commands *without* having to update the telemetry code. For example, the work to gather the command line arguments/options passed, to gather project info and environment setup, are all set up in a standardized way and sanitize such data of PII.",https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/commit/ef32b2fea053970e32e530cea30239337f8975df,48009214,microsoft/react-native-windows,False,False

(#1438)////CoreGraphics.Drawing.UnitTests can now be invoked in one of two modes, mediated by command line flags:////* `--compare[=/path/to/reference/folder]` (_default mode_) compare all rendered images against their baselines, failing the test if any images differ by even a single pixel.//* `--generate [--out=/path/to/output/directory]` generate output images only (do not run comparisons.)////A failing test will emit a brightly-colored diff image to `Greenlines.TestImage.CASE.TEST.png` in the _output directory_, and attach attributes to the gtest output XML data specifying where to find the images. A compatible test runner can load these images and display them side-by-side.////**Open Questions/Concerns**//* I do not like the design of `rgba/bgraPixels`.//* I do not take stride into account; if the image is width-padded, the tests will ikely fail.//* The reference platform loads images in RGBA, and we load them in BGRA.

(#1496)////This changeset introduces support for transparency layers. Transparency layers serve as render targets that are composed down to the backing surface in one fell swoop.////To make way for this, CGContext was mildly refactored://* Existing private (denoted by `__CGContextX`) methods were moved into `__CGContext` the class as `__CGContext::X`.//* Graphics state manipulation was promoted to `__CGContext`.//* Some methods were promoted to drawing state methods (clipping, draw decision)//* `__CGContextLayer`, a class that tracks a stack of drawing states and their destination buffers, was introduced.//* CGContext's render target setup was moved into its constructor.//* `globalAlpha` was reintroduced, as sometimes per-primitive alpha is just not enough. *Such as: layers are composed down all at once using the alpha set at the time the context was created.*////Deficiencies://* Clipped layers are implemented in terms of a baseline clipping state applied to the layer. All primitives are drawn through a Direct2D **PushLayer** and **PopLayer** pair.//* Alpha-composited layers are implemented in terms of the same.//* There is some dodgy math witnessed on the reference platform that grows shadowed layers by some combination of shadow offset and width; an attempt was made to mimic this.//* Minor layering violations that pass a `__CGContext` to a `CGContextXxx()` public function by way of **this**.////Fixes #1427, #584.////* Implement CGPathApply (#1507)////* CGPathApply////* Curve Apply Test Page////* Update tests, address CR feedback, move geometry sink to individual file.////* Addressing CR Feedback.////* Fix no-op on cgpathapply when path is null.////* Address CR Feedback////* Single element point arrays are now just a variable////* Ignoring clang warnings on ARM builds for WRL helpers.////* Replace lost ID from last commit.////* Remove bitmap context hack from NSTextContainer////* Fix Affine Transform in CGPath (#1550)////* Affine Transform////* Remove excess com pointer usage from getters.////* Update API status.////* Enable Path Tests + Reference Images////* Disabled AddEllipseInRect test until CGContextSetStrokeColor is supported.////* Add support for copying subregions from CGIWICBitmap.////References #1379.////* Convert CGBitmapContext's image on output (if data isn't provided).////* Convert ImageIO to use CGImage's WIC internals directly.////Additionally, clean up some EXPECT/ASSERT/_MSG in ImageIO Tests.////Fixes #1287.////* Tidy CGImage's list of supported pixel and rendering formats.////Add some more bitmap format tests, and adjust the rest of the tests to//match.////* Fix CoreGraphics.Drawing's image loader & premultiplied alpha.////* The unpremultiplier here matches the algorithm used in WIC.//* A test image has been added that will load unpremultiplied, but render//  premultiplied.////* Add support+tests for clipping context rendering to an image mask. (#1528)////This pull request adds support for clipping rendering into a context by an image or an image mask in terms of Direct2D opacity brushes.////An image mask is a grayscale image whose pixel values range from 0 to 100%, and those values are taken as inverse alpha. That is: a fully black image (px=0.0) will be rendered through at alpha 1.0; a fully white pixel will be at alpha 0.0 and values between the two will be interpolated appropriately.////Masks can be stacked. This is implemented in terms of a double composite operation; the two opacity brushes are combined and used to draw a black region into a new image. The new image will serve as the final bitmap backing the new opacity brush.////Since Direct2D does not support b/w masks natively, an effort was undertaken to translate them into alpha channel masks.////Black/white masks do, unfortunately, not work with CGBitmapContext as-is.

(#1949)////Fixes #1930.////* This change includes the addition of a few new features to UIButton. (#1920)////* This change includes the addition of a few new features to UIButton.  Some functionality deviates from the reference platform, but we feel that it aligns more closely with the default look and feel of Xaml buttons on Windows because buttons 'look' pressed in more cases with these changes, and there are straightforward ways to opt out of this behavior if it's not desired.////**adjustsImageWhenDisabled/adjustsImageWhenHighlighted**://We're adding WinObjC-specific support for adjustsImageWhenDisabled and adjustsImageWhenHighlighted.  On the reference platform, this tinting/darkening behavior is ONLY applied to the button's background an foreground images, but on our platform, the tintening/darkening is applied to the entire button's bounds (including its background color), but NOT to its label text.  The primary justification for this approach is that there's not a straighforward way to tint Xaml Images on RS1, yet this approach also helps us implement simple SystemButton support and it makes UIButtons appear a bit more 'windows-like' in many cases, since they show more distinct pressed behavior.  The behavior is as follows; if adjustsImageWhenDisabled is set to YES, and if no UIControlStateDisabled properties are set on the button, then the entire button contents (aside from its label) receives a lightening effect.  Similar behavior is implemented for adjustsImageWhenHighlighted.  The way to opt-out of this behavior is to either set a single UIControlStateDisabled/UIControlStateHighlighted property, or to set adjustsImageWhenDisabled/adjustsImageWhenHighlighted to NO.////**SystemButton (aka buttonWithType)**://We're adding support for UIButtonTypeSystem, which behaves as follows:////	- Default background is white.//	- Receives a default text color of (blue/green) [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0f green:0.47843137f blue:1.0f alpha:1.0f] which applies to all states (unless set otherwise)//	- Default to UIColor lightTextColor for disabled titleLabelColor////**SystemButton - Deviations from the Reference Platform**://	- When selected, the entire label background turns the default text color (blue/green) [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0f green:0.47843137f blue:1.0f alpha:1.0f], and the text color is changed to white.  This seems like a corner case that we're not implementing until we need to for a customer.////	- When highlighted, the titleLabel contents (its text and any sublayer content) are tinted to a darker/greyed out version of the normal state.//		- Instead of this behavior, we're piggy-backing off of our adjustsImageWhenHighlighted implementation to avoid needing to do this extra work.  The button *looks* highlighted, so we don't have to change the text color.////	- On the reference platform, when disabled, text is grey by default, UNLESS any custom normal or disabled text colors are set.  On our platform, we DEFAULT to disabled to grey text and then you can change it, but changing the normal color won't affect the default color (for the sake of simplicity).////Scrubbed Annotations://All UIButton annotations have been scrubbed and updated with 'NotInPlan' status as needed.////Fixes #1442//Fixes #1885//Fixes #1671//Fixes #1671////Fixes VSO 10145069.//Fixes VSO 9533114.////* Adding comments + clang-format.////* Incorporating CR feedback.////* Fixing up UIButton tests.////* Partial revert of 8bbd30f739343b5afa73e63a33583cfda10eaf4d (#1957)////* Partial revert of 8bbd30f739343b5afa73e63a33583cfda10eaf4d////* Fixing lab tests.

The position is transformed by the inverse of the text transform, so when the glyph is drawn and transformed by the real text transform it will have the correct position. This has the added benefit of allowing us to draw a glyph run which has a transformed text matrix all together, rather than glyph-by-glyph as we did previously.////Because text drawing is being batched, attributes which are handled at draw time on a run-per-run basis such as fill color need to be done in DrawGlyphRuns. The attribute names are defined in CoreText, though all of them are just CoreGraphics attributes, so local values have been added to CGContext.mm and exported for the CT/UIKit versions as CG.////Images have been updates since changing this seems to have enabled antialiasing to some degree on several tests.////Fixes #1933//Fixes #1935////* Fixing naming of UIKit.Label helper method: TextBox->TextBlock.

20,a25ac52ccf9bf27dc0828e6c0b535c3ac898fd86,"Component Registry Improvements (#435)//The major change here is that now ComponentRegistries support containing other ComponentRegistries, rather than just factories. This removes the wrapping anti-pattern where a registry would call a sub registry's get directly which would make the sub registry in-accessible. Since the sub registry was in-accessible it couldn't have other IComponent* extensions. Getting the sub registries is important for a number of scenarios. For instance the registry may provide meta-data about the packages it contains which can be useful for component pickers. A specific package registry could also provide features like copy/paste and upgrade.////This also results in fewer registries being created, as most cases just wanted to propagate entries for the registry, which is now also supported in the first class way, and is backwards compatible with maps as registries, which is by far the largest use case.////The patterns for creating true sub registries is now to create them explicitly, and with a name; just like any other entry. The fits nicely with the component sub-registry pattern. For example, a cdn registry could be named ""cdn"", and have it's entry added to the container regsitry, [""cdn"", Promise.Resolve(new CdnRegistry())]. Components created from this regisitry would then have a package path like [""cdn"", ""@some-scope/some-pkg@some-version"", ""some-component""]. This would tell the the remote context to lookup the registry ""cdn"" off the container registry, and then ask that registry for the package registry, and then finally for the component factory.////Changes:////Remove ComponentFactoryTypes. This was for backwards compatibility which floating factory functions. these are not used anymore, so this can be removed.////Remove ComponentRegistryTypes. This was used to allow map to be used as registries. This however created problems, in that maps don't expose our feature detection interfaces. However, all public api's the took ComponentRegistryTypes, now take NamedComponentRegistires which is a iteratable, and map compatible.////Pass the component's IComponentRegistry to the component runtime, and make it available off IComponentRuntime. This allows easy access to the component's registry for feature discovery.",https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/a25ac52ccf9bf27dc0828e6c0b535c3ac898fd86,203843667,microsoft/FluidFramework,False,False

It's request() method is renamed to resolveHandle().//This reduces number of responsibilities for both interfaces and makes it clearer on the purpose of interfaces.//Note: This causes DataStoreRuntime to have both request() & resolveHandle().//In next iteration, they will have different behaviors - DDS URIs will fail to resolve when request comes in through request(). I.e. it would be impossible to request DDS from data store unless data store handler implements such access.//This is equivalent to making DDSs private on a data store class.////2. 'path' is removed from both IFluidHandle & IFluidRouter. It has been marked deprecated for many versions.////3. Introducing handleFromLegacyUri() for back compat. Using it in couple places in this change to scope amount of churn - all places where it's used needs revisit. More on that below.////4. Fixing how we refer to task manager ID and how we access task manager & agent scheduler. In many places code confuses data store ID vs. type (even though they are the same thing).//Exposing task manager on IContainerRuntimeBase. More on future changes here below.////5. Vltava: changing registry creation pattern - hiding component type names, forcing everything to go through factories. Same pattern should be expanded to all of our examples, as name we use in registry not always matches type on a factory.//   - Also removing using package name as component type - that has pretty big impact on bundle sizes, and is backward compat hazard - type name can't change, which is not obvious looking at package.json.////6. Last edited is simplified - async load path is deprecated, with assumption that it is being used on a critical path of container loading, with detached container creation.////7. PureDataObject method names are busted due to renames for many users (i.e. componentInitializingFirstTime is still used in code in derived classes, when such method was renamed on base class).////Follow up for # 3 & 4 above://Next step will be to pass data object dependencies to them directly through scoping mechanism on object creation, and start removing access to ""globals"" in container. The most obvious example why it's bad is PureDataObject.getService() & getMatchMakerContainerService() implementations. Consumers of those are likely not aware that generateContainerServicesRequestHandler() has to be used by container developer. In fact, getMatchMakerContainerService() is not used in our repo (other than UT)!//Better approach is to pass these dependencies through local (to object) scope, and force fluid object implementation to grab and store such dependencies (using handles) within data object itself, for future use. PureDataObjectFactory.instantiateInstance() can validate required dependencies are present.

Still, the timings speak for themselves and it's easy enough to transition back if that ever becomes necessary.////If this experiment goes well, we might consider a similar change to update our webpack config to use `swc-loader` instead of `ts-loader`.////One of the reasons `swc` is so much faster is that it does not perform type-checking. Right now we do type-checking as part of build, but if we were to switch webpack to use swc, we'd then need a separate build step for type-checking (comparable to the current `yarn null:check` step).////Implementation notes://* There are a few subtly important things in the `.swcrc` file, which unfortunately doesn't support comments://    * The `noInterop: true` flag is the equivalent of TypeScript's default `esModuleInterop: false` behavior. It is necessary; we use several modules which cannot be used correctly with interop behavior in play. See https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1778 for details.//    * The empty `""env"": {}` property is necessary to trigger `swc` to respect the `browserslist` entry in `package.json`//    * Directing `swc` to target a reasonably recent set of browsers (via the new `browserslist` entry in `package.json`) is required; there are several tests with snapshots that change under default targeting, and there are a few components that break outright.//    * `tsx: true` is required (it tells `swc` to enable support for `tsx` files; it doesn't prevent non-tsx files from parsing)//* For now, this is using a custom Jest transformer to call `@swc/core`. The swc project maintains a `@swc/jest` transformer, but https://github.com/swc-project/jest/issues/8 prevents it from being able to use the `noInterop: true` setting we require, and I can't submit a PR to patch the project until legal rubber stamps their CLA//* `collapsible-script-provider.tsx` required a hacky workaround for https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1165//    * even after applying the workaround, running jest with and without `--coverage=false` emitted javascript with different whitespace. `collapsible-script-provider.test.ts` needed to be updated to format the resulting js before snapshotting it.//* `src/scanner/processor.ts` used a mutable global in a module to enable its tests to inject test data. This confused swc; I replaced it with a more typical ctor injection pattern.//* `browser-adapter-factory.test.tsx` did a dance around an `import 'webextension-polyfill-ts';` statement to trick the module into thinking `window.chrome.runtime.id` is defined (it checks for this during import and refuses to load if it is not set). The dance we used is not compliant with how ES6 imports are defined to work (they are defined as hoisting import statements to the top of the file, ie, before we stub the window property). TypeScript has an outstanding PR/issue to stop supporting what we were previously doing (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/39764) and swc intentionally doesn't support it (https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1686) (babel doesn't either), so I had to modify how our dance worked by moving it to a separate file and having it use a raw `require()` rather than an `import`.////#### Pull request checklist//<!-- If a checklist item is not applicable to this change, write ""n/a"" in the checkbox -->//- [n/a] Addresses an existing issue: #0000//- [x] Ran `yarn fastpass`//- [x] Added/updated relevant unit test(s) (and ran `yarn test`)//- [x] Verified code coverage for the changes made.

Each pattern is first converted into an ordered list of predicates starting from the root operation. A predicate is composed of three distinct parts:/* Position/  - A position refers to a specific location on the input DAG, i.e. an/    existing MLIR entity being matched. These can be attributes, operands,/    operations, results, and types. Each position also defines a relation to/    its parent. For example, the operand `[0] -> 1` has a parent operation/    position `[0]` (the root)./* Question/  - A question refers to a query on a specific positional value. For/  example, an operation name question checks the name of an operation/  position./* Answer/  - An answer is the expected result of a question. For example, when/  matching an operation with the name ""foo.op"". The question would be an/  operation name question, with an expected answer of ""foo.op"".//After the predicate lists have been created and ordered(based on occurrence of common predicates and other factors), they are formed into a tree of nodes that represent the branching flow of a pattern match. This structure allows for efficient construction and merging of the input patterns. There are currently only 4 simple nodes in the tree:/* ExitNode: Represents the termination of a match/* SuccessNode: Represents a successful match of a specific pattern/* BoolNode/SwitchNode: Branch to a specific child node based on the expected answer to a predicate question.//Once the matcher tree has been generated, this tree is walked to generate the corresponding interpreter operations.// ** The Rewriter:/The rewriter portion of a pattern is generated in a very straightforward manor, similarly to lowerings in other dialects. Each PDL operation that may exist within a rewrite has a mapping into the interpreter dialect. The code for the rewriter is generated within a FuncOp, that is invoked by the interpreter on a successful pattern match. Referenced values defined in the matcher become inputs the generated rewriter function.//An example lowering is shown below://```mlir/// The following high level PDL pattern:/pdl.pattern : benefit(1) {/  %resultType = pdl.type/  %inputOperand = pdl.input/  %root, %results = pdl.operation ""foo.op""(%inputOperand) -> %resultType/  pdl.rewrite %root {/    pdl.replace %root with (%inputOperand)/  }/}//// is lowered to the following:/module {/  // The matcher function takes the root operation as an input./  func @matcher(%arg0: !pdl.operation) {/    pdl_interp.check_operation_name of %arg0 is ""foo.op"" -> ^bb2, ^bb1/  ^bb1:/    pdl_interp.return/  ^bb2:/    pdl_interp.check_operand_count of %arg0 is 1 -> ^bb3, ^bb1/  ^bb3:/    pdl_interp.check_result_count of %arg0 is 1 -> ^bb4, ^bb1/  ^bb4:/    %0 = pdl_interp.get_operand 0 of %arg0/    pdl_interp.is_not_null %0 : !pdl.value -> ^bb5, ^bb1/  ^bb5:/    %1 = pdl_interp.get_result 0 of %arg0/    pdl_interp.is_not_null %1 : !pdl.value -> ^bb6, ^bb1/  ^bb6:/    // This operation corresponds to a successful pattern match./    pdl_interp.record_match @rewriters::@rewriter(%0, %arg0 : !pdl.value, !pdl.operation) : benefit(1), loc([%arg0]), root(""foo.op"") -> ^bb1/  }/  module @rewriters {/    // The inputs to the rewriter from the matcher are passed as arguments./    func @rewriter(%arg0: !pdl.value, %arg1: !pdl.operation) {/      pdl_interp.replace %arg1 with(%arg0)/      pdl_interp.return/    }/  }/}/```//Differential Revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D84580",https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc-clang/commit/8a1ca2cd347cf80b377b36d1a7af3f31ec5b575e,60645050,microsoft/checkedc-clang,False,False

This class contains a ModuleOp with the pdl::PatternOp operations representing the patterns, as well as a collection of registered C++ functions for native constraints/creations/rewrites/etc. that may be invoked via the pdl patterns. Instances of this class are added to an OwningRewritePatternList in the same fashion as C++ RewritePatterns, i.e. via the `insert` method.//The PDL bytecode is an in-memory representation of the PDL interpreter dialect that can be efficiently interpreted/executed. The representation of the bytecode boils down to a code array(for opcodes/memory locations/etc) and a memory buffer(for storing attributes/operations/values/any other data necessary). The bytecode operations are effectively a 1-1 mapping to the PDLInterp dialect operations, with a few exceptions in cases where the in-memory representation of the bytecode can be more efficient than the MLIR representation. For example, a generic `AreEqual` bytecode op can be used to represent AreEqualOp, CheckAttributeOp, and CheckTypeOp.//The execution of the bytecode is split into two phases: matching and rewriting. When matching, all of the matched patterns are collected to avoid the overhead of re-running parts of the matcher. These matched patterns are then considered alongside the native C++ patterns, which rewrite immediately in-place via `RewritePattern::matchAndRewrite`,  for the given root operation. When a PDL pattern is matched and has the highest benefit, it is passed back to the bytecode to execute its rewriter.//Differential Revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D89107",https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc-clang/commit/abfd1a8b3bc5ad8516a83c3ae7ba9f16032525ad,60645050,microsoft/checkedc-clang,False,False

20,979d63d50c0c0f7bc537bf821e056cc9fe5abd38,"bpf: prevent out of bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic//Jann reported that the original commit back in b2157399cc98/(""bpf: prevent out-of-bounds speculation"") was not sufficient/to stop CPU from speculating out of bounds memory access:/While b2157399cc98 only focussed on masking array map access/for unprivileged users for tail calls and data access such/that the user provided index gets sanitized from BPF program/and syscall side, there is still a more generic form affected/from BPF programs that applies to most maps that hold user/data in relation to dynamic map access when dealing with/unknown scalars or ""slow"" known scalars as access offset, for/example://  - Load a map value pointer into R6/  - Load an index into R7/  - Do a slow computation (e.g. with a memory dependency) that/    loads a limit into R8 (e.g. load the limit from a map for/    high latency, then mask it to make the verifier happy)/  - Exit if R7 >= R8 (mispredicted branch)/  - Load R0 = R6[R7]/  - Load R0 = R6[R0]//For unknown scalars there are two options in the BPF verifier/where we could derive knowledge from in order to guarantee/safe access to the memory: i) While </>/<=/>= variants won't/allow to derive any lower or upper bounds from the unknown/scalar where it would be safe to add it to the map value/pointer, it is possible through ==/!= test however. ii) another/option is to transform the unknown scalar into a known scalar,/for example, through ALU ops combination such as R &= <imm>/followed by R |= <imm> or any similar combination where the/original information from the unknown scalar would be destroyed/entirely leaving R with a constant. The initial slow load still/precedes the latter ALU ops on that register, so the CPU/executes speculatively from that point. Once we have the known/scalar, any compare operation would work then. A third option/only involving registers with known scalars could be crafted/as described in [0] where a CPU port (e.g. Slow Int unit)/would be filled with many dependent computations such that/the subsequent condition depending on its outcome has to wait/for evaluation on its execution port and thereby executing/speculatively if the speculated code can be scheduled on a/different execution port, or any other form of mistraining/as described in [1], for example. Given this is not limited/to only unknown scalars, not only map but also stack access/is affected since both is accessible for unprivileged users/and could potentially be used for out of bounds access under/speculation.//In order to prevent any of these cases, the verifier is now/sanitizing pointer arithmetic on the offset such that any/out of bounds speculation would be masked in a way where the/pointer arithmetic result in the destination register will/stay unchanged, meaning offset masked into zero similar as/in array_index_nospec() case. With regards to implementation,/there are three options that were considered: i) new insn/for sanitation, ii) push/pop insn and sanitation as inlined/BPF, iii) reuse of ax register and sanitation as inlined BPF.//Option i) has the downside that we end up using from reserved/bits in the opcode space, but also that we would require/each JIT to emit masking as native arch opcodes meaning/mitigation would have slow adoption till everyone implements/it eventually which is counter-productive. Option ii) and iii)/have both in common that a temporary register is needed in/order to implement the sanitation as inlined BPF since we/are not allowed to modify the source register. While a push //pop insn in ii) would be useful to have in any case, it/requires once again that every JIT needs to implement it/first. While possible, amount of changes needed would also/be unsuitable for a -stable patch. Therefore, the path which/has fewer changes, less BPF instructions for the mitigation/and does not require anything to be changed in the JITs is/option iii) which this work is pursuing. The ax register is/already mapped to a register in all JITs (modulo arm32 where/it's mapped to stack as various other BPF registers there)/and used in constant blinding for JITs-only so far. It can/be reused for verifier rewrites under certain constraints./The interpreter's tmp ""register"" has therefore been remapped/into extending the register set with hidden ax register and/reusing that for a number of instructions that needed the/prior temporary variable internally (e.g. div, mod). This/allows for zero increase in stack space usage in the interpreter,/and enables (restricted) generic use in rewrites otherwise as/long as such a patchlet does not make use of these instructions./The sanitation mask is dynamic and relative to the offset the/map value or stack pointer currently holds.//There are various cases that need to be taken under consideration/for the masking, e.g. such operation could look as follows:/ptr += val or val += ptr or ptr -= val. Thus, the value to be/sanitized could reside either in source or in destination/register, and the limit is different depending on whether/the ALU op is addition or subtraction and depending on the/current known and bounded offset. The limit is derived as/follows: limit := max_value_size - (smin_value + off). For/subtraction: limit := umax_value + off. This holds because/we do not allow any pointer arithmetic that would/temporarily go out of bounds or would have an unknown/value with mixed signed bounds where it is unclear at/verification time whether the actual runtime value would/be either negative or positive. For example, we have a/derived map pointer value with constant offset and bounded/one, so limit based on smin_value works because the verifier/requires that statically analyzed arithmetic on the pointer/must be in bounds, and thus it checks if resulting/smin_value + off and umax_value + off is still within map/value bounds at time of arithmetic in addition to time of/access. Similarly, for the case of stack access we derive/the limit as follows: MAX_BPF_STACK + off for subtraction/and -off for the case of addition where off := ptr_reg->off +/ptr_reg->var_off.value. Subtraction is a special case for/the masking which can be in form of ptr += -val, ptr -= -val,/or ptr -= val. In the first two cases where we know that/the value is negative, we need to temporarily negate the/value in order to do the sanitation on a positive value/where we later swap the ALU op, and restore original source/register if the value was in source.//The sanitation of pointer arithmetic alone is still not fully/sufficient as is, since a scenario like the following could/happen ...//  PTR += 0x1000 (e.g. K-based imm)/  PTR -= BIG_NUMBER_WITH_SLOW_COMPARISON/  PTR += 0x1000/  PTR -= BIG_NUMBER_WITH_SLOW_COMPARISON/  [...]//... which under speculation could end up as ...//  PTR += 0x1000/  PTR -= 0 [ truncated by mitigation ]/  PTR += 0x1000/  PTR -= 0 [ truncated by mitigation ]/  [...]//... and therefore still access out of bounds. To prevent such/case, the verifier is also analyzing safety for potential out/of bounds access under speculative execution. Meaning, it is/also simulating pointer access under truncation. We therefore/""branch off"" and push the current verification state after the/ALU operation with known 0 to the verification stack for later/analysis. Given the current path analysis succeeded it is/likely that the one under speculation can be pruned. In any/case, it is also subject to existing complexity limits and/therefore anything beyond this point will be rejected. In/terms of pruning, it needs to be ensured that the verification/state from speculative execution simulation must never prune/a non-speculative execution path, therefore, we mark verifier/state accordingly at the time of push_stack(). If verifier/detects out of bounds access under speculative execution from/one of the possible paths that includes a truncation, it will/reject such program.//Given we mask every reg-based pointer arithmetic for/unprivileged programs, we've been looking into how it could/affect real-world programs in terms of size increase. As the/majority of programs are targeted for privileged-only use/case, we've unconditionally enabled masking (with its alu/restrictions on top of it) for privileged programs for the/sake of testing in order to check i) whether they get rejected/in its current form, and ii) by how much the number of/instructions and size will increase. We've tested this by/using Katran, Cilium and test_l4lb from the kernel selftests./For Katran we've evaluated balancer_kern.o, Cilium bpf_lxc.o/and an older test object bpf_lxc_opt_-DUNKNOWN.o and l4lb/we've used test_l4lb.o as well as test_l4lb_noinline.o. We/found that none of the programs got rejected by the verifier/with this change, and that impact is rather minimal to none./balancer_kern.o had 13,904 bytes (1,738 insns) xlated and/7,797 bytes JITed before and after the change. Most complex/program in bpf_lxc.o had 30,544 bytes (3,817 insns) xlated/and 18,538 bytes JITed before and after and none of the other/tail call programs in bpf_lxc.o had any changes either. For/the older bpf_lxc_opt_-DUNKNOWN.o object we found a small/increase from 20,616 bytes (2,576 insns) and 12,536 bytes JITed/before to 20,664 bytes (2,582 insns) and 12,558 bytes JITed/after the change. Other programs from that object file had/similar small increase. Both test_l4lb.o had no change and/remained at 6,544 bytes (817 insns) xlated and 3,401 bytes/JITed and for test_l4lb_noinline.o constant at 5,080 bytes/(634 insns) xlated and 3,313 bytes JITed. This can be explained/in that LLVM typically optimizes stack based pointer arithmetic/by using K-based operations and that use of dynamic map access/is not overly frequent. However, in future we may decide to/optimize the algorithm further under known guarantees from/branch and value speculation. Latter seems also unclear in/terms of prediction heuristics that today's CPUs apply as well/as whether there could be collisions in e.g. the predictor's/Value History/Pattern Table for triggering out of bounds access,/thus masking is performed unconditionally at this point but could/be subject to relaxation later on. We were generally also/brainstorming various other approaches for mitigation, but the/blocker was always lack of available registers at runtime and/or/overhead for runtime tracking of limits belonging to a specific/pointer. Thus, we found this to be minimally intrusive under/given constraints.//With that in place, a simple example with sanitized access on/unprivileged load at post-verification time looks as follows://  # bpftool prog dump xlated id 282/  [...]/  28: (79) r1 = *(u64 *)(r7 +0)/  29: (79) r2 = *(u64 *)(r7 +8)/  30: (57) r1 &= 15/  31: (79) r3 = *(u64 *)(r0 +4608)/  32: (57) r3 &= 1/  33: (47) r3 |= 1/  34: (2d) if r2 > r3 goto pc+19/  35: (b4) (u32) r11 = (u32) 20479  |/  36: (1f) r11 -= r2                | Dynamic sanitation for pointer/  37: (4f) r11 |= r2                | arithmetic with registers/  38: (87) r11 = -r11               | containing bounded or known/  39: (c7) r11 s>>= 63              | scalars in order to prevent/  40: (5f) r11 &= r2                | out of bounds speculation./  41: (0f) r4 += r11                |/  42: (71) r4 = *(u8 *)(r4 +0)/  43: (6f) r4 <<= r1/  [...]//For the case where the scalar sits in the destination register/as opposed to the source register, the following code is emitted/for the above example://  [...]/  16: (b4) (u32) r11 = (u32) 20479/  17: (1f) r11 -= r2/  18: (4f) r11 |= r2/  19: (87) r11 = -r11/  20: (c7) r11 s>>= 63/  21: (5f) r2 &= r11/  22: (0f) r2 += r0/  23: (61) r0 = *(u32 *)(r2 +0)/  [...]//JIT blinding example with non-conflicting use of r10://  [...]/   d5:	je     0x0000000000000106    _/   d7:	mov    0x0(%rax),%edi       |/   da:	mov    $0xf153246,%r10d     | Index load from map value and/   e0:	xor    $0xf153259,%r10      | (const blinded) mask with 0x1f./   e7:	and    %r10,%rdi            |_/   ea:	mov    $0x2f,%r10d          |/   f0:	sub    %rdi,%r10            | Sanitized addition.

(#1528)////This pull request adds support for clipping rendering into a context by an image or an image mask in terms of Direct2D opacity brushes.////An image mask is a grayscale image whose pixel values range from 0 to 100%, and those values are taken as inverse alpha.

This is implemented in terms of a double composite operation; the two opacity brushes are combined and used to draw a black region into a new image.

(#1949)////Fixes #1930.////* This change includes the addition of a few new features to UIButton. (#1920)////* This change includes the addition of a few new features to UIButton.  Some functionality deviates from the reference platform, but we feel that it aligns more closely with the default look and feel of Xaml buttons on Windows because buttons 'look' pressed in more cases with these changes, and there are straightforward ways to opt out of this behavior if it's not desired.////**adjustsImageWhenDisabled/adjustsImageWhenHighlighted**://We're adding WinObjC-specific support for adjustsImageWhenDisabled and adjustsImageWhenHighlighted.  On the reference platform, this tinting/darkening behavior is ONLY applied to the button's background an foreground images, but on our platform, the tintening/darkening is applied to the entire button's bounds (including its background color), but NOT to its label text.  The primary justification for this approach is that there's not a straighforward way to tint Xaml Images on RS1, yet this approach also helps us implement simple SystemButton support and it makes UIButtons appear a bit more 'windows-like' in many cases, since they show more distinct pressed behavior.  The behavior is as follows; if adjustsImageWhenDisabled is set to YES, and if no UIControlStateDisabled properties are set on the button, then the entire button contents (aside from its label) receives a lightening effect.  Similar behavior is implemented for adjustsImageWhenHighlighted.  The way to opt-out of this behavior is to either set a single UIControlStateDisabled/UIControlStateHighlighted property, or to set adjustsImageWhenDisabled/adjustsImageWhenHighlighted to NO.////**SystemButton (aka buttonWithType)**://We're adding support for UIButtonTypeSystem, which behaves as follows:////	- Default background is white.//	- Receives a default text color of (blue/green) [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0f green:0.47843137f blue:1.0f alpha:1.0f] which applies to all states (unless set otherwise)//	- Default to UIColor lightTextColor for disabled titleLabelColor////**SystemButton - Deviations from the Reference Platform**://	- When selected, the entire label background turns the default text color (blue/green) [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0f green:0.47843137f blue:1.0f alpha:1.0f], and the text color is changed to white.  This seems like a corner case that we're not implementing until we need to for a customer.////	- When highlighted, the titleLabel contents (its text and any sublayer content) are tinted to a darker/greyed out version of the normal state.//		- Instead of this behavior, we're piggy-backing off of our adjustsImageWhenHighlighted implementation to avoid needing to do this extra work.  The button *looks* highlighted, so we don't have to change the text color.////	- On the reference platform, when disabled, text is grey by default, UNLESS any custom normal or disabled text colors are set.  On our platform, we DEFAULT to disabled to grey text and then you can change it, but changing the normal color won't affect the default color (for the sake of simplicity).////Scrubbed Annotations://All UIButton annotations have been scrubbed and updated with 'NotInPlan' status as needed.////Fixes #1442//Fixes #1885//Fixes #1671//Fixes #1671////Fixes VSO 10145069.//Fixes VSO 9533114.////* Adding comments + clang-format.////* Incorporating CR feedback.////* Fixing up UIButton tests.////* Partial revert of 8bbd30f739343b5afa73e63a33583cfda10eaf4d (#1957)////* Partial revert of 8bbd30f739343b5afa73e63a33583cfda10eaf4d////* Fixing lab tests.

The position is transformed by the inverse of the text transform, so when the glyph is drawn and transformed by the real text transform it will have the correct position. This has the added benefit of allowing us to draw a glyph run which has a transformed text matrix all together, rather than glyph-by-glyph as we did previously.////Because text drawing is being batched, attributes which are handled at draw time on a run-per-run basis such as fill color need to be done in DrawGlyphRuns. The attribute names are defined in CoreText, though all of them are just CoreGraphics attributes, so local values have been added to CGContext.mm and exported for the CT/UIKit versions as CG.////Images have been updates since changing this seems to have enabled antialiasing to some degree on several tests.////Fixes #1933//Fixes #1935////* Fixing naming of UIKit.Label helper method: TextBox->TextBlock.

26,518c2b7874153eeaa4779abde356985473b0debd,"Restrictions on redeclarations of no prototype functions. (#76)//Calls to no-prototype functions are not type checked according to the C specification (Section 6.5.2.2 of the C11 specification).  The lack of type checking allows the checking of bounds declarations to be bypassed.   For the Checked C extension, this is addressed by not allowing redeclarations of no-prototype functions to have prototypes that use checked types, as well as not allowing checked values to be passed to no-prototype functions.  Section 5.5 of the Checked C extension specification describes the restrictions.  ////This change implements the Checked C restrictions on redeclarations of no-prototype functions.  It is  part of work on issue #30.    The restrictions are implemented by changing the implementation of C type compatibility in clang.   We make no-prototype function types incompatible with function types that take arguments or return values that have checked types, contain values with checked types embedded within them, or are recursively pointers to function types that take or return check types.  We also change the construction of function types from function declarators to enforce the Checked C rule that a no-prototype function cannot have a checked return type.////When two declarations of a function are incompatible, we try to diagnose whether a failure is due to a Checked C type compatibility rule and print descriptive error messages.   We do this only when the failure  is because of the presence or absence of a prototype of a declaration.  We do not try to diagnose type compatibility problems involving parameters with function pointer types,  In that case, programmers will get a generic ""types are not compatible"" message.////There is a subtle complication when checking redeclarations in the presence of incomplete structure or union types.  In the Checked C rules, a function type with an incomplete type is compatible with a no-prototype function (because the incomplete type is unknown).  For a series of declarations of a function, clang merges the types so that the latest declaration has the merged type.  This means that a function could start as a no-prototype function, be given a prototype with an incomplete type, the incomplete type could be completed to be  checked type, and then the function could be declared again://```//int f();      // decl 1//struct S;//int f(S v);   // decl 2//// complete the type//struct S {//  ptr<int> p;//}//...//int f(S v) {  // decl 3 (possibly a definition)//  ...//}//```//clang looks at only the type of the prior declaration when merging declaration types.  For Checked C, this misses the fact that `f` was declared originally  as a no-prototype function at `decl 1`.   The prototype was allowed only because it involved an incomplete type at `decl 2`.  If we had the complete type at `decl 2`, the prototype would not have been allowed.  Instead of looking at just the prior declaration, we look back at all prior declarations of a function to make sure they are compatible with the current declaration of the function.////Note that we still need to prevent `decl 2` from being used after `S` is complete.  The current change only addresses redeclarations of `f`, not uses of `f`.   That is  future work tracked by issue #75. ////In the implementation of type compatibility, we miss the case of no-prototype function pointers being incompatible with prototype function pointers that take integer arguments with bounds.  This depends on issue #20 (adding bounds to function types).  We will address this case as part of issue #20.////Testing://- This change uncovered places in existing tests in the Checked C repo where we were using no prototype functions.  Update the tests to properly declare the functions as having no arguments (using the `f(void)` pattern).//- Add a new tests on to Checked C repo in typechecking\no_prototype_functions.c.//- Add some clang-specific tests under tests\CheckedC\typechecking.c.//- Passes the updated and new Checked C tests.//- Passes the existing clang regression tests.",https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc-clang/commit/518c2b7874153eeaa4779abde356985473b0debd,60645050,microsoft/checkedc-clang,False,False

Clang needs to emit the thunk without necessarily/having access to the complete prototype of foo.//This change makes Clang emit a musttail variadic call when it needs such/a thunk. I call these ""unprototyped"" thunks, because they only prototype/the ""this"" parameter, which must always come first in the MS C++ ABI.//These thunks work, but they create ugly LLVM IR. If the call to the/thunk is devirtualized, it will be a call to a bitcast of a function/pointer. Today, LLVM cannot inline through such a call, but I want to/address that soon, because we also use this pattern for virtual member/pointer thunks.//This change also implements an old FIXME in the code about reusing the/thunk's computed CGFunctionInfo as much as possible. Now we don't end up/computing the thunk's mangled name and arranging it's prototype up to/around three times.//Fixes PR25641//Reviewers: rjmccall, rsmith, hans//Subscribers: Prazek, cfe-commits//Differential Revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D45112//git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk@329009 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8",https://github.com/microsoft/clang/commit/eadc8a81ef3df4c986bd9b0f6676e0e49646fa0f,29706297,microsoft/clang,False,False

LegalizeVectorOps legalizes bottom up while LegalizeDAG legalizes top down. The bottom up strategy for LegalizeVectorOps means operands are legalized before their uses. So we promote and/or/xor before we legalize the operands that use them making computeKnownBits/computeNumSignBits in places like LowerTruncate suboptimal. I looked at changing LegalizeVectorOps to be top down as well, but that was more disruptive and caused some regressions. I also looked at just moving promotion of binops to LegalizeDAG, but that had a few issues one around matching AND,ANDN,OR into VSELECT because I had to create ANDN as vXi64, but the other nodes hadn't legalized yet, I didn't look too hard at fixing that.//This patch seems to produce better results overall than my other attempts. We now form broadcasts of constants better in some cases. For at least some of them the AND was being introduced in LegalizeDAG, promoted to vXi64, and the BUILD_VECTOR was also legalized there. I think we got bad ordering of that. Now the promotion is out of the legalizer so we handle this better.//In the longer term I think we really should evaluate whether we should be doing this promotion at all.

Changes in details://* HandleNameConflict return with a false DeclarationName//Hitherto we effectively never returned with a NameConflict error, even/if the preceding StructuralMatch indicated a conflict./Because we just simply returned with the parameter `Name` in/HandleNameConflict and that name is almost always `true` when converted to/`bool`.//* Add tests which indicate wrong NameConflict handling//* Add to ConflictingDecls only if decl kind is different//Note, we might not indicate an ODR error when there is an existing record decl/and a enum is imported with same name.  But there are other cases. E.g. think/about the case when we import a FunctionTemplateDecl with name f and we found a/simple FunctionDecl with name f. They overload.  Or in case of a/ClassTemplateDecl and CXXRecordDecl, the CXXRecordDecl could be the 'templated'/class, so it would be false to report error.  So I think we should report a/name conflict error only when we are 100% sure of that.  That is why I think it/should be a general pattern to report the error only if the kind is the same.//* Fix failing ctu test with EnumConstandDecl//In ctu-main.c we have the enum class 'A' which brings in the enum/constant 'x' with value 0 into the global namespace./In ctu-other.c we had the enum class 'B' which brought in the same name/('x') as an enum constant but with a different enum value (42).

22,a0b9470673cf59fa27e8415a962151380fcc4981,"[X86] Move promotion of vector and/or/xor from legalization to DAG combine//Summary:/I've noticed that the bitcasts we introduce for these make computeKnownBits and computeNumSignBits not work well in LegalizeVectorOps. LegalizeVectorOps legalizes bottom up while LegalizeDAG legalizes top down. The bottom up strategy for LegalizeVectorOps means operands are legalized before their uses. So we promote and/or/xor before we legalize the operands that use them making computeKnownBits/computeNumSignBits in places like LowerTruncate suboptimal. I looked at changing LegalizeVectorOps to be top down as well, but that was more disruptive and caused some regressions. I also looked at just moving promotion of binops to LegalizeDAG, but that had a few issues one around matching AND,ANDN,OR into VSELECT because I had to create ANDN as vXi64, but the other nodes hadn't legalized yet, I didn't look too hard at fixing that.//This patch seems to produce better results overall than my other attempts. We now form broadcasts of constants better in some cases. For at least some of them the AND was being introduced in LegalizeDAG, promoted to vXi64, and the BUILD_VECTOR was also legalized there. I think we got bad ordering of that. Now the promotion is out of the legalizer so we handle this better.//In the longer term I think we really should evaluate whether we should be doing this promotion at all.

The visitor pattern is not particularly good for that because by/the time you have performed the dynamic type dispatch, it's too late to/go back to the parent node, and change its pointer. The previous code/dealt with that relatively elegantly, but it still meant that one had to/perform manual type checks, which is what the visitor pattern is/supposed to avoid.//The second issue was not being able to return values from the Visit/functions, which meant that one had to store function results in member/variables (a common problem with visitor patterns).//Here, I solve both problems by making the visitor use a type switch/instead of going through double dispatch on the visited object.  This/allows one to parameterize the visitor based on the return type and pass/function results as function results. The mutation is fascilitated by/having each Visit function take two arguments -- a reference to the/object itself (with the correct dynamic type), and a reference to the/parent's pointer to this object.//Although this wasn't my explicit goal here, the fact that we're not/using virtual dispatch anymore  allows us to make the AST nodes/trivially destructible, which is a good thing, since we were not/destroying them anyway.//Reviewers: aleksandr.urakov, amccarth//Subscribers: lldb-commits//Differential Revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D60410//llvm-svn: 358261",https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc-clang/commit/85ce053d7e2614d65b3506b3a32748c8454f3810,60645050,microsoft/checkedc-clang,False,False

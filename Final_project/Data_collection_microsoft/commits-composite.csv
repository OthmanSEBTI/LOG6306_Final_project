This previously didn't work because composites like obj.field_name was returned from the staged AutoGraph conditional, meaning that both branches needed to supply a value for obj.field_name. Returning and setting composites is now restricted to conditionals that are staged in TensorFlow.//Note that a conditional that assigns to composite symbols that are not defined before the conditional will result in an AttributeError in staged TensorFlow code (i.e. if the condition is a Tensor).

(#1438)////CoreGraphics.Drawing.UnitTests can now be invoked in one of two modes, mediated by command line flags:////* `--compare[=/path/to/reference/folder]` (_default mode_) compare all rendered images against their baselines, failing the test if any images differ by even a single pixel.//* `--generate [--out=/path/to/output/directory]` generate output images only (do not run comparisons.)////A failing test will emit a brightly-colored diff image to `Greenlines.TestImage.CASE.TEST.png` in the _output directory_, and attach attributes to the gtest output XML data specifying where to find the images. A compatible test runner can load these images and display them side-by-side.////**Open Questions/Concerns**//* I do not like the design of `rgba/bgraPixels`.//* I do not take stride into account; if the image is width-padded, the tests will ikely fail.//* The reference platform loads images in RGBA, and we load them in BGRA.

(#1496)////This changeset introduces support for transparency layers. Transparency layers serve as render targets that are composed down to the backing surface in one fell swoop.////To make way for this, CGContext was mildly refactored://* Existing private (denoted by `__CGContextX`) methods were moved into `__CGContext` the class as `__CGContext::X`.//* Graphics state manipulation was promoted to `__CGContext`.//* Some methods were promoted to drawing state methods (clipping, draw decision)//* `__CGContextLayer`, a class that tracks a stack of drawing states and their destination buffers, was introduced.//* CGContext's render target setup was moved into its constructor.//* `globalAlpha` was reintroduced, as sometimes per-primitive alpha is just not enough. *Such as: layers are composed down all at once using the alpha set at the time the context was created.*////Deficiencies://* Clipped layers are implemented in terms of a baseline clipping state applied to the layer. All primitives are drawn through a Direct2D **PushLayer** and **PopLayer** pair.//* Alpha-composited layers are implemented in terms of the same.//* There is some dodgy math witnessed on the reference platform that grows shadowed layers by some combination of shadow offset and width; an attempt was made to mimic this.//* Minor layering violations that pass a `__CGContext` to a `CGContextXxx()` public function by way of **this**.////Fixes #1427, #584.////* Implement CGPathApply (#1507)////* CGPathApply////* Curve Apply Test Page////* Update tests, address CR feedback, move geometry sink to individual file.////* Addressing CR Feedback.////* Fix no-op on cgpathapply when path is null.////* Address CR Feedback////* Single element point arrays are now just a variable////* Ignoring clang warnings on ARM builds for WRL helpers.////* Replace lost ID from last commit.////* Remove bitmap context hack from NSTextContainer////* Fix Affine Transform in CGPath (#1550)////* Affine Transform////* Remove excess com pointer usage from getters.////* Update API status.////* Enable Path Tests + Reference Images////* Disabled AddEllipseInRect test until CGContextSetStrokeColor is supported.////* Add support for copying subregions from CGIWICBitmap.////References #1379.////* Convert CGBitmapContext's image on output (if data isn't provided).////* Convert ImageIO to use CGImage's WIC internals directly.////Additionally, clean up some EXPECT/ASSERT/_MSG in ImageIO Tests.////Fixes #1287.////* Tidy CGImage's list of supported pixel and rendering formats.////Add some more bitmap format tests, and adjust the rest of the tests to//match.////* Fix CoreGraphics.Drawing's image loader & premultiplied alpha.////* The unpremultiplier here matches the algorithm used in WIC.//* A test image has been added that will load unpremultiplied, but render//  premultiplied.////* Add support+tests for clipping context rendering to an image mask. (#1528)////This pull request adds support for clipping rendering into a context by an image or an image mask in terms of Direct2D opacity brushes.////An image mask is a grayscale image whose pixel values range from 0 to 100%, and those values are taken as inverse alpha. That is: a fully black image (px=0.0) will be rendered through at alpha 1.0; a fully white pixel will be at alpha 0.0 and values between the two will be interpolated appropriately.////Masks can be stacked. This is implemented in terms of a double composite operation; the two opacity brushes are combined and used to draw a black region into a new image. The new image will serve as the final bitmap backing the new opacity brush.////Since Direct2D does not support b/w masks natively, an effort was undertaken to translate them into alpha channel masks.////Black/white masks do, unfortunately, not work with CGBitmapContext as-is.

(#1804)////This is riddled with caveats, many of which are documented in the code.////A first pass attempt was made to implement a format converter that would run//per-primitive. It's expensive, but it did get the job done.////Unfortunately, asking WIC to convert a PRGBA buffer to a G8 buffer causes it to//discard all alpha data -- even if premultiplied, the luminance of//partially-transparent pixels is not appropriately reduced in the final G8 image.//This impacts alpha-heavy uses such as grayscale font rendering.////The A8 implementation was chosen for maximal compatibiltiy with Cocos2D. Cocos2D//renders white (!) text into a ""grayscale"" buffer that it then passes off to//OpenGLES as a `GL_ALPHA8` buffer.

(#1949)////Fixes #1930.////* This change includes the addition of a few new features to UIButton. (#1920)////* This change includes the addition of a few new features to UIButton.  Some functionality deviates from the reference platform, but we feel that it aligns more closely with the default look and feel of Xaml buttons on Windows because buttons 'look' pressed in more cases with these changes, and there are straightforward ways to opt out of this behavior if it's not desired.////**adjustsImageWhenDisabled/adjustsImageWhenHighlighted**://We're adding WinObjC-specific support for adjustsImageWhenDisabled and adjustsImageWhenHighlighted.  On the reference platform, this tinting/darkening behavior is ONLY applied to the button's background an foreground images, but on our platform, the tintening/darkening is applied to the entire button's bounds (including its background color), but NOT to its label text.  The primary justification for this approach is that there's not a straighforward way to tint Xaml Images on RS1, yet this approach also helps us implement simple SystemButton support and it makes UIButtons appear a bit more 'windows-like' in many cases, since they show more distinct pressed behavior.  The behavior is as follows; if adjustsImageWhenDisabled is set to YES, and if no UIControlStateDisabled properties are set on the button, then the entire button contents (aside from its label) receives a lightening effect.  Similar behavior is implemented for adjustsImageWhenHighlighted.  The way to opt-out of this behavior is to either set a single UIControlStateDisabled/UIControlStateHighlighted property, or to set adjustsImageWhenDisabled/adjustsImageWhenHighlighted to NO.////**SystemButton (aka buttonWithType)**://We're adding support for UIButtonTypeSystem, which behaves as follows:////	- Default background is white.//	- Receives a default text color of (blue/green) [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0f green:0.47843137f blue:1.0f alpha:1.0f] which applies to all states (unless set otherwise)//	- Default to UIColor lightTextColor for disabled titleLabelColor////**SystemButton - Deviations from the Reference Platform**://	- When selected, the entire label background turns the default text color (blue/green) [UIColor colorWithRed:0.0f green:0.47843137f blue:1.0f alpha:1.0f], and the text color is changed to white.  This seems like a corner case that we're not implementing until we need to for a customer.////	- When highlighted, the titleLabel contents (its text and any sublayer content) are tinted to a darker/greyed out version of the normal state.//		- Instead of this behavior, we're piggy-backing off of our adjustsImageWhenHighlighted implementation to avoid needing to do this extra work.  The button *looks* highlighted, so we don't have to change the text color.////	- On the reference platform, when disabled, text is grey by default, UNLESS any custom normal or disabled text colors are set.  On our platform, we DEFAULT to disabled to grey text and then you can change it, but changing the normal color won't affect the default color (for the sake of simplicity).////Scrubbed Annotations://All UIButton annotations have been scrubbed and updated with 'NotInPlan' status as needed.////Fixes #1442//Fixes #1885//Fixes #1671//Fixes #1671////Fixes VSO 10145069.//Fixes VSO 9533114.////* Adding comments + clang-format.////* Incorporating CR feedback.////* Fixing up UIButton tests.////* Partial revert of 8bbd30f739343b5afa73e63a33583cfda10eaf4d (#1957)////* Partial revert of 8bbd30f739343b5afa73e63a33583cfda10eaf4d////* Fixing lab tests.

The position is transformed by the inverse of the text transform, so when the glyph is drawn and transformed by the real text transform it will have the correct position. This has the added benefit of allowing us to draw a glyph run which has a transformed text matrix all together, rather than glyph-by-glyph as we did previously.////Because text drawing is being batched, attributes which are handled at draw time on a run-per-run basis such as fill color need to be done in DrawGlyphRuns. The attribute names are defined in CoreText, though all of them are just CoreGraphics attributes, so local values have been added to CGContext.mm and exported for the CT/UIKit versions as CG.////Images have been updates since changing this seems to have enabled antialiasing to some degree on several tests.////Fixes #1933//Fixes #1935////* Fixing naming of UIKit.Label helper method: TextBox->TextBlock.
